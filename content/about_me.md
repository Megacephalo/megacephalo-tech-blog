Hi everyone, this is Charly Huang and I am a software engineer interested in autonomous navigation related algorithms and software development. Since little I was fascinated by autonomous robots and this passion has since them motivated me to pursue more advanced degrees and careers in the related fields. As of today, there are still a great number of issues in the autonomous driving realm waiting to be overcome in order to make automated vehicles safe and reliable. To this end,I want to contribute head-on and hands-on to make autonomous driving a true reality in the near future. 

I love to solve problems creatively from the big picture all the way down to the details. I take pride in creating beautiful designs and implementing them that not only bring solutions, but also boost maintainability and scalability. I know that every step in crafting the product comes with great responsibility but one inch closer to fulfilling the mission. 

I want to share with the world what I have learned and worked on the autonomous robotics fields and what a better place to host my finding knowledge in a blog. 

On the other hand, please feel free to direct-message me if you see potential collaborations between us. Thank you.
